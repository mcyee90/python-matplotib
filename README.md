# python-matplotib

I created graphs to depict ride demographics for a ride sharing company. I used ride date to create a bubble plot, which shows the relationship between four key variables.
1. Average Fare per City
2. Total Number of Riders per city
3. Total Number of Drivers per City
4. City Type

Also, pie charts were created for total fares by city types, total rides by city type and total drivers by city type. 

Python's MatPlotLib Library was used including the alpha, edge color and linewidths arguments to create all the graphs.
